why collection cannot be used to extend the map? 
-because collections is made for the data structures which operates on a single value and the map is a data structure 
which has a pair i.e. key-value pair 
-it cannot be made to extend since it contains key-value instead of only value 
-its method and properties fails for map 

properties of map:
-contains the key value pairs 
-cannot contain the duplicate keys 
-implementations of map are:
    -hashmap: do not maintain the order 
    -linkedhashmap: maintains the insertion order 
    -treemap:sorts the data internally (order maintain)
    -hashtable: synchronized version of hashmap (it is thread safe)
-put method:
    -if the key is not in the map, then it inserts the key-value pair into the map 
    -if the key is present in the map, then it overrides the value of the key
