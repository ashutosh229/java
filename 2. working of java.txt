features of java:
-platform independent language 
-follow the OOPs principles 
-portability (WORA)

3 main components of java:
1. JVM
    - Java Virtual Machine 
    - it is an abstract machine 
    - by abstract, we mean to say that it do not exist physically but exist as a software 
    - java program -> compiler -> compiled code (bytecode)-> JVM -> machine code -> can be run on any machine 
    - since JVM converts the compiled code into the machine code which can be run anywhere on any machine, it is 
    the JVM only which provides us the level of portability which we have in java 
    - JVM is a platform dependent software and it is different for different platforms depending on the specifications of the platform in use 
    - JVM contains JIT compiler where JIT stands for Just In Time
    - independence of the components in terms of platform:
        - java program: independent
        - compiler: independent 
        - bytecode: independent
        - JVM: dependent
        - machine code: independent
    -we have the .java file as the java program
    -the compiler converts it to .class file which is the bytecode 
    -the JVM then converts it to .exe file which is the machine code or the executable file which can be run on any machine 
2. JRE
    - Java Runtime Environment 
    - It contains the JVM and the class libraries 
    - the byte code can contain the usage of some class libraries also and therefore the libraries should be present for the HVM 
    to use and therefore the libraries along with the JVM should be present in the JRE for JVM to run the byte code 
    - therefore if we have the JRE alone, we can run the bytecode and convert to machine code 
    - if we have only JVM, then we cannot run the bytecode since we dont have the class libraries to understand
3. JDK
    - Java Development Kit 
    - it contains everything which we need to have for writting the java program 
    - it contains the programming language java, the compiler need to compile the code and the debugger 
    - it also contains the JRE alongside these things 
    - therefore the JDK is the ultimate thing which we need to have for writing, compiling and running the java code 
    - therefore whenever you want to work with java, you should have JDK downloaded into your machine 

platform independence of the components:
JVM is platfrom dependent and therefore
JRE is also platform dependent and therefore
JDK is also platform dependent

some other important terms:
1. JSE
    - Java Standard Edition
    - It is basically the standard java or the basic java or the fundamental or the core java which we learn as a early developer 
    - it contains only the basics like classes, multithreading, inheritance, etc. features
2. JEE
    - Java Enterprise Edition
    - This edition of java is used in industries to develop large scale applications 
    - It comes with JSE along with some additional features like APIs, Servelets, JSP, Transactional APIs, Persistence API, etc. 
3. JME
    - Java Micro/Mobile Edition
    - It contains the JSE along with some features and APIs needed for the mobile applications development 

How to write a java program?
1. the name of the file will be same as the name of the class 
2. there will be only one public class in a file 
3. there can be states, constructors, methods, nested classes in a class 
4. main() method is the starting point of the program, when the bytecode is generated, the JVM executes the bytecode starting from the main() method in the bytecode itself 

why only 1 public class in one java file?
it all is needed because JVM is need to run the main method
