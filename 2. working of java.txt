features of java:
-platform independent language 
-follow the OOPs principles 
-portability (WORA)

3 main components of java:
1. JVM
    - Java Virtual Machine 
    - it is an abstract machine 
    - by abstract, we mean to say that it do not exist physically but exist as a software 
    - java program -> compiler -> compiled code (bytecode)-> JVM -> machine code -> can be run on any machine 
    - since JVM converts the compiled code into the machine code which can be run anywhere on any machine, it is 
    the JVM only which provides us the level of portability which we have in java 
    - JVM is a platform dependent software and it is different for different platforms depending on the specifications of the platform in use 
    - JVM contains JIT compiler where JIT stands for Just In Time
    - independence of the components in terms of platform:
        - java program: independent
        - compiler: independent 
        - bytecode: independent
        - JVM: dependent
        - machine code: independent
    -we have the .java file as the java program
    -the compiler converts it to .class file which is the bytecode 
    -the JVM then converts it to .exe file which is the machine code or the executable file which can be run on any machine 
2. JRE
    - Java Runtime Environment 
    - It contains the JVM and the class libraries 
    - the byte code can contain the usage of some class libraries also and therefore the libraries should be present for the HVM 
    to use and therefore the libraries along with the JVM should be present in the JRE for JVM to run the byte code 
    - therefore if we have the JRE alone, we can run the bytecode and convert to machine code 
    - if we have only JVM, then we cannot run the bytecode since we dont have the class libraries to understand
3. JDK
    - Java Development Kit
