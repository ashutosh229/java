stream:
-stream is a pipeline through which our collection elements passes through 
-when the collection elements passes through the stream, it can undergo multiple operations like sorting, filtering, etc. 
depending on the way we construct the pipeline 
-useful when we deal with bulk processing (processing a lot of data)
-useful when we have to perform parallel processing 

components of stream:
-we have a collection with us 
-step1: create a stream, from the data source like array or collection or etc.
-step2: intermediate operations:
    -they are the operations performed on the stream
    -there can be multiple intermediate operations
    -they have some logic like filter, sort, map, distinct, etc. 
    -the output is again a stream on which the operations can be performed again
    -they are lazy in nature
-step3: terminal operations:
    -they are the operations which occurs at the end of the stream 
    -there can be only one terminal operation 
    -like collect, reduce, count, etc. 
    -these operations produces the output of the stream 
    -after the terminal operation, the stream gets closed and no further operations can be performed on 

lazy nature of intermediate operations:
-the lazy nature means that the intermediate operations wont take place until and unless we apply the terminal 
operation on the stream
   
different ways of creating a stream:
-using collection 
-using arrays 
-using static method "of" of "Stream" class 
-using stream builder
-using stream iterate
