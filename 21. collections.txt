java collections framework:
-added in java version 1.2 
-collections is nothing but a group of objects just like array(group of entities), strings (group of characters)
-present in java.util package 
-this framework provide us the entire architecture to manage these group of objects i.e. ability to add, delete, update, search,
sort, etc.
-before JCF, there was no such proper framework and therefore we were supposed to remember the methods for each data 
structure and it was difficult to do so
-JCF solved this problem as it provided a common interface for all the collections 

heirarchy of java collections framework:
-see it from the net 

iterable:
-provides the way of iterating the collection
-ways of iterating any collection:
1. using the iterator method 
2. using the forEach method 
3. using the conventional for(int val: values) loop

collection:
-provides us the methods for working on a group of objects  
-before the introduction of iterable in java 1.5, the method used to iterate the object was iterator() present in collection 
-there are methods for streaming and stream processing 
-there are other methods which are common for all the collections in the JCF heirarchy

difference between collection and collections:
-collection:
    -part of the JCF 
    -it is an interface 
    -other data structures implements it 
    -contains a lot of methods for all the data structures 
-collections:
    -utility class 
    -provides static methods which are used to operate on collections 
    -like swapping, sorting, searching, etc.
