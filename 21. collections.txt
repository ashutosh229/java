java collections framework:
-added in java version 1.2 
-collections is nothing but a group of objects just like array(group of entities), strings (group of characters)
-present in java.util package 
-this framework provide us the entire architecture to manage these group of objects i.e. ability to add, delete, update, search,
sort, etc.
-before JCF, there was no such proper framework and therefore we were supposed to remember the methods for each data 
structure and it was difficult to do so
