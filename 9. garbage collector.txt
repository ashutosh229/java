2 types of memory:
stack 
heap 

both the types of memory are created by the JVM 
both the types of memory are stored in the RAM 

stack:
stores the temporary variables and separate memory block for methods 
store primitive data types 
store the reference of the heap objects
each thread has its own stack memory but they share a common heap memory
