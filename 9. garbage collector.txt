2 types of memory:
stack 
heap 

both the types of memory are created by the JVM 
both the types of memory are stored in the RAM 

stack:
stores the temporary variables and separate memory block for methods 
store primitive data types 
store the reference of the heap objects
each thread has its own stack memory but they share a common heap memory
variables within a scope is only visible and as soon as the variable goes out of the scope, it gets deleted from the 
stack in LIFO order 
when the stack is full,then we get the java.lang.StackOverflowError

types of references:
-strong reference:
-weak reference:

the garbage collector deletes all the objects and strings in the string pool, from the heap when they are not referenced by 
any other variable in the stack 
the garbage collector runs periodically and deletes the objects in the heap 
the JVM is responsible for running the garbage collector
we can explicitly run the garbage collector using the system.gc() command in the application code 
even if we use the above command, there is no guarantee that the garbage collector will be ran and it all 
depends on the JVM 
therefore it is called automatic memory management 


one very concept is to make the stack and heap diagram from the code segment given
