process and thread:
-process is an instance of a program that is getting executed or is running 
-when a program is running, it requires a lot of resources like memory, thread, etc. 
-process requires a lot of resources in short 
-OS allocates these resources to the process when the  process is created 
-process has its own resources and no two processes shares their resources with each other
-processes are therefore isolated 
-thread is known as a lightweight process 
-smallest sequence of instructions which are executed by the CPU independently 
-if a program contains 10 instructions, and a CPU can execute only 5 instructions independently, then there will be 2 threads 
i.e. T1 and T2 
-one process contains a lot of threads
-when a process is created, it contains a single thread and that initial thread is known as the main thread
-multiple threads are created out from the main thread to perform the tasks concurrently
