data types:
    - primitive:
        - built in data types 
        - byte(8), short(16), int(32), long(64), float(32), double(64), char(16), boolean(1)
    - reference:
        - custom built data types, by the user 
        - strings, arrays, classes, interfaces 

type conversion/casting:
    - implicit:
        - this is internal conversion
        - occurs when converting the smaller datatype into larger 
        - done automatically by the compiler 
        - its safe and no data is lost
        - byte → short → int → long → float → double
        - char can be widened to int, long, float, or double
    - explicit:
        - this is external conversion 
        - occurs when the large data type is converted into smaller 
        - not done automatically by the compiler because it can lead to loss in data 
        - should be done by the programmer 
        - explicit conversions can lead to loss of precision or unexpected results if not handled carefully
        - targetType variableName = (targetType) currentVariable (or value)
