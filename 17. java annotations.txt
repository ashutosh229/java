annotations:
-feature in java
-introduced in java 5
-introduced to reduce the need of the XML files in which the configurations or the metadata of the code used to be witten
-helps us to add metadata to the java code
-by metadata, we mean that it provides us the information about the java code but is not the part of the program
-since they are not the part of the java code, they have no direct effect on the operation of the code but can be used by the 
compiler or at runtime to perform certain actions
-this metadata is used by the compilers, development tools, or at runtime to influence the program
