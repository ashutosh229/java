reflection:
-feature of java 
-helps to inspect and manipulate the runtime behaviour of the applications running in the JVM 
-because it helps us to get the details about the multiple entities of a java program even if we dont know their name or any
other identifier 
-it enables the examination and modification of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, even if their 
names are not known until runtime
-basically, har chij jan saktein hain during runtime

classes present in the reflection API:
-Class<T>: provides us the class and interface object for the classes and interfaces and then we can extract every information about that class or interface 
-Field: provides the object for the field and then we can extract every information about the field of the class or interface
-Method: provides the object for the method and then we can extract every information about the method of the class or interface 
-Constructor<T>: provides the object for the constructors and then we can extract every information about the constructor of the class 
-Modifier: provides us with static methods and constants, to decode classes and member class modifiers
