there are formats for storing the floating point numbers in the memory
the most common format which we follow is the IEEE754 format 
in that format, we have a way of converting the floating point number to the memory representation and vice versa 
due to the algorithm, when we fetch the value back from the memory, the value which we get is something else than
the value which we have stored in the variable 
this happens with only some values and not with every floating point number which we store 

you need to know just the algorithm of storing the value into the memory and then fetching it back again
