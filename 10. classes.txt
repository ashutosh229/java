concrete class: a class that provides implementations for all its methods and can be instantiated to create objects 
abstract class: cannot be instantiated on its own and can contain the abstract methods which are to be implemented by the subclass 
nested:
- class which is defined inside a class
    - static:
        -does not have the access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class but have the one for the class variables and methods 
        -these classes can be instantiated without the object of the outer class 
        -using the dot operator i.e. outer.nested nester = new outer.nested()
    - non-static:
        -also called the inner classes 
        -there are 3 types defined here:
            - local: 
                - defined within a method 
                - accessible only within the method 
            - anonymous:
                - unnamed class 
                - defined and instantiated in a single expression
                -
