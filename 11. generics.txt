generic classes:
-these classes as the name suggests allows us to define a generalized datatype as the 
type parameter in them
-we pass this parameter at the time of class instantiation 
-class className<T>{} where T is the type placeholder used here 
-benefits:
    - type safety
    - code reusability
    - elimination of type casting 
-bounded type parameters: we can bound the parameter for using only some values when the class 
is instantiated 
for e.g., class NumberBox<T extends Number> {} 
in the example above, T can only take the types which are the subclasses of the Number class 

wildcards:
-they are used in java generics
-they are represented by the question mark (?)
-denoting an unknown type 
-unbounded wildcards:
    - represents an unknown type 
    - useful when the method can be implemented using methods in the Object class since 
    the type of the parameter is unknown
