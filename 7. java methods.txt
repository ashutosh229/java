methods are the codeblocks which helps us to perform some task by introducing code reusability and modularity 

how a method is declared in java:
access specifier 
static/non-static
return type 
methodName 
parameters 
method Body 

types of methods in java:
system defined methods: defined in the built in libraries of java 
user defined methods: defined by the user 
overloaded methods: methods which are overloaded 
overriden methods: methods which are overriden 
static methods: they belong to the class and not to the objects of the class and they can be called without 
creating the object of the class. They cannot access the instance states and methods directly 
final methods: these cannot be overriden by the subclasses and these methods ensures that the behaviour remains unchanged in the subclass also 
abstract methods: methods which are declared without an implementation and must be implemented by subclasses 
and they are defined in the abstract classes 

varargs in java:
-they have been introduced in java 5
-they allow to pass zero or more arguments of the same type in the method 
-only one varargs parameter is allowed per method
-the varargs parameter should be the last parameter in the parameter's list of the function
-inside the method, the varargs parameter is treated as an array
