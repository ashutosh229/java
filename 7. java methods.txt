methods are the codeblocks which helps us to perform some task by introducing code reusability and modularity 

types of methods in java:
system defined methods: defined in the built in libraries of java 
user defined methods: defined by the user 
overloaded methods: methods which are overloaded 
overriden methods: methods which are overriden 
static methods: they belong to the class and not to the objects of the class and they can be called without 
creating the object of the class. They cannot access the instance states and methods directly 
final methods: these cannot be overriden by the subclasses and these methods ensures that the behaviour remains unchanged in the subclass also 
abstract methods: methods which are declared without an implementation and must be implemented by subclasses 
and they are defined in the abstract classes
