when we write some state in the class, we can access it via two ways:
1. plain access: state 
2. reference access: this.state

interface is an entity in java which contains the functions without any proper implementation

there are two things: extends and implements 
extends: 
    -class and class (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
    -interface and interface (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
implements: 
    -class and interface (solution of the diamond problem)
    -if we implement an interface from a class, we have to override the functions of the interface and write their concrete 
    implementation 

extends:
    class extends class 
    1 class cannot extend multiple classes
    1 class can be extended by multiple classes

    interface extends interface 
    1 interface can extend multiple interfaces 
    1 interface can be extended by multiple interfaces

implements:
class implements interface 
1 class can implement multiple interfaces 
1 interface can be implemented by multiple classes

private:
cannot be inherited by the subclasses/interfaces 

static:
static entities can be accessed by static or non-static  
non-static entities can be accessed by non-static but non static 

compile-time v/s run-time:
during compile time, the control is with the programmer and compilation of code is done by compiler and output is compiled code  
during run time, the control is with the machine and running is done by the JVM and the output is the bytecode 

why fields and methods are not generic?
because their types are injected by the generic type present in their generic class and therefore they dont need to be generic 

why constructors are generic? 
because while creating the object, the type injected into the class should be provided and the object creation occurs 
via the constructor which means that the provisioning of the type can happen via the constructor itself and therefore, it 
should be generic too, just like the class
