when we write some state in the class, we can access it via two ways:
1. plain access: state 
2. reference access: this.state

interface is an entity in java which contains the functions without any proper implementation

there are two things: extends and implements 
extends: 
    -class and class (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
    -interface and interface (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
implements: 
    -class and interface (solution of the diamond problem)
    -if we implement an interface from a class, we have to override the functions of the interface and write their concrete 
    implementation 

extends:
    class extends class 
    1 class cannot extend multiple classes
    1 class can be extended by multiple classes

    interface extends interface 
    1 interface can extend multiple interfaces 
    1 interface can be extended by multiple interfaces

implements:
class implements interface 
1 class can implement multiple interfaces 
1 interface can be implemented by multiple classes
