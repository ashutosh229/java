when we write some state in the class, we can access it via two ways:
1. plain access: state 
2. reference access: this.state

there are two things: extends and implements 
extends: 
    -class and class (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
    -interface and interface (inheritance: single, multilevel, hierarchial)
implements: 
    -class and interface (solution of the diamond problem)
